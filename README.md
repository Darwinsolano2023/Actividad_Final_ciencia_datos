# Data Transformation Algorithm

This project is a Python script designed to download data from Google Drive, process it using the `pandas` library, and apply specific transformations to generate useful outputs. It is especially helpful when you need to automate data retrieval and manipulation.

## What does this script do?

The script uses a **Google service account** to access Google Drive files. It downloads the file (e.g., a CSV or spreadsheet), transforms the data using `pandas`—a powerful Python library for data analysis—and outputs the modified data. This can be useful for automating data workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, you need to:

1. Have **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
2. Set up a **Google service account** with the necessary permissions to access the files on Google Drive.
3. Install several Python libraries required for the script to work.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Google Cloud credentials** (service account credentials in JSON format).
- **Python libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation.
  - `google-auth`: For authenticating with Google services.
  - `google-auth-oauthlib`: Required for OAuth 2.0 authorization.
  - `google-auth-httplib2`: Additional tools for handling HTTP requests with Google.
  - `google-api-python-client`: The core library for accessing Google APIs like Google Drive.

## How to Install and Set Up

### 1. Clone or download the project

First, you'll need to get the script onto your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>

Or you can simply download the script file.

### 2. Install the required Python libraries
Next, you need to install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
